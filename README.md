# desk-hub
A custom KM/USB switch for my desk. 

## Goals
- 10(+) USB Ports
- 2 input switchable
- Stable 5V power to all ports
- Separate overdraw protection
- Electronically controllable
- Visual indicator of port use and overdraw
- Multiple switching points to split input across machines
- USB3?



## Rationale 
Currently, I have two UGreen 4 port USB switches taped to my desk. Each morning I press the button on each to switch to work, and each afternoon I press the button to switch back. They cannot always reliably provide enough amps to each downstream port and my audio cuts out sometimes. Very occasionally they initialize incorrectly and I must remove all connections and reconnect them to gain control again. The downstream and upstream ports are also all on opposite sides, leading to many wires curling back on themselves. 

I aim to solve these issues in an overengineered board of my own design, as an opportunity to learn slightly higher speed PCB design and 4 layer boards.
